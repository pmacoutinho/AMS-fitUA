# [AMS] fitUA
 Android app for the gym of University of Aveiro. 
 Project of "Análise e Modelação de Sistemas" course.
 First experience programming for Android.
 
 Best used with a virtual Pixel 4 XL within Android Studio, the app is not compatible with every screen size!
 
 Virtual phones don't allow you to install apps, so every time the fitUA has to open an app (like whatsapp or zoom) you just get redirected to the app's respective website
 
 Tests were done using Android Espresso
 (How to run them -> https://developer.android.com/studio/test/espresso-test-recorder#run-an-espresso-test-locally)
